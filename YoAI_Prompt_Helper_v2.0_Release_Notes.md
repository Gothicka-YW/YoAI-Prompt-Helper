# YoAI Prompt Helper — Community Edition

## v2.0 (2026-01-25)

### Highlights
- Theme selector (Resources tab) with multiple built-in themes: Dark, Valentine’s, Gothicka, Elven, Cats, Calico.
- Calico theme background pattern support (kept readable via CSS variables).

### Changed
- Updated multiple avatar presets to a newer structured “constraint-first” prompt format (identity lock, composition rules, priority order).
- UI styling updated so the area outside the rounded popup frame no longer shows an opaque background (reduces the “ghostly white” margin effect).

### Fixed
- Theme selection is persisted independently and is not overridden by form-state persistence.

### Install / Update
- Chrome: `chrome://extensions` → enable Developer Mode → Load unpacked → select the extension folder.
- If already installed, click Reload after updating.
