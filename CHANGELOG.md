# Changelog

## [2.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- Theme selector (Resources tab) with multiple built-in themes: Dark, Valentine’s, Gothicka, Boho Chic, Fruity, Calico.
- Calico theme background pattern support (kept readable via CSS variables).

### Changed
- Updated multiple avatar presets to a newer structured “constraint-first” prompt format (identity lock, composition rules, priority order).
- UI styling updated so the area outside the rounded popup frame no longer shows an opaque background (reduces the “ghostly white” margin effect).

### Fixed
- Theme selection is persisted independently and is not overridden by form-state persistence.

## [1.0] - Initial release
- Initial Community Edition release with Avi Presets, BG Presets, Creator, My Presets, and Resources.
